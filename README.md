# GeneRegulate-Tool

Welcome to GeneRegulate, your place to explore the intricate landscape of gene regulation and its powerful impact on precision medicine. This GitHub hosts the source code and documentation for GeneRegulate, an new bioinformatics tool designed to help researchers and medical professionals with understanding gene regulatory elements.

### What is GeneRegulate?

GeneRegulate is a powerful web tool that allows you to analyze gene regulatory elements, the molecular switches that control when and how genes are turned on or off. By understanding these elements, we can unlock crucial information about tissue-specific gene expression, leading to breakthroughs in precision medicine.


### Upcoming Publication: We are actively working towards publishing GeneRegulate by October. 

### How Does GeneRegulate Work?

1. **Choose Your Tissue of Interest:** GeneRegulate provides a seamless interface for selecting the tissue you want to study. With options for more than 8 tissue types and plans to expand to 48, you have the freedom to explore the tissue that you are interested in learning more about it.

2. **Data Input Options:** You can either use our pre-loaded data for easy research or upload your own data. Simply provide gene lists, enhancer data, and silencer data in the needed format, to start the prosses

3. **Analyzing Regulatory Elements:** GeneRegulate processes the data and expertly connects each regulatory element to its corresponding gene. It even shows gene expression levels within the selected tissue, providing a comprehensive view.

4. **Visualization:** The tool presents your results in user-friendly formats, including tables and graphs. You can choose the visualization that suits your preference, making complex data easier to understand.

### Important Note: The processing of files is currently not integrated into Flask due to ongoing edits. We are actively working on identifying and solving the errors, as we are trying to make it better in terms of the run time Once it is completed, this feature will be included in routes.py.

### Why GeneRegulate Matters

GeneRegulate isn't just about data analysis but advancing precision medicine. By deciphering how genes are controlled, we can uncover the roots of diseases and develop targeted treatments. Imagine being able to turn off a specific gene that is the main reason for genetic disses.

### Future Improvements

We're committed to continuous enhancement. Currently, we're using the hg19 version of the human genome, but we plan to incorporate newer versions. We're also working on accepting different file formats, not just .bed files, to accommodate user needs. Furthermore, we aim to expand our analysis to cover various gene regulatory elements beyond enhancers and silencers, as runtime allows.
